## Model Architecture

### YOLOv8 Architecture â€“ Key Components

- **Conv**  
  Standard convolutional layer used to extract features from the input image using kernels, stride, and padding.

- **C2f**  
  "Cross Stage Partial with 2 convolution blocks" â€“ an efficient variant of CSP blocks that reduces the number of parameters while maintaining performance.

- **Concat**  
  Concatenates tensors from different layers to combine multi-scale feature information (commonly used in encoder-decoder skip connections).

- **Upsample**  
  Increases the spatial resolution of feature maps (usually via nearest-neighbor interpolation) to enable fusion with higher-resolution features.

- **Detect**  
  The final detection head that predicts bounding box coordinates, object classes, and confidence scores for each detected object.
